// Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
// is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
//
// Note:
// The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
// You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
// Example 1:
// Input: 5
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
// ts complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
// Example 2:
// Input: 1
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
// its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

const findComplement = n => parseInt(n.toString(2).split``.map(x => x == 1 ? '0' : '1').join``, 2);

console.log(findComplement(5));
