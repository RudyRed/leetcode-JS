// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
// Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping
// you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system
// connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses
// were broken into on the same night.
//
// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
// house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without
// alerting the police.
